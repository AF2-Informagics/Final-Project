Our site as a whole brings about lots of different portions within UW to make it easier for the students. Information from rate my professor, the UW schedules, as well as what buildings are nearby can be easily accessed. For example, if someone was looking for which class to take based on professor, our design allows the ratings to be easily found and shown so the users can compare. When looking at classes, if I’m debating between Neal Koblitz, Matthew Conroy, and Alexandra Nichifor, I can see that their 3 ratings show 2.5, 3.0, and 4.7 respectively. This leads me to believe Alexandra would be the best choice if I went forward to take her class.

Our design also makes it very accessible for students to look for buildings and which buildings are close by and accessible. If I had to run from MGH to Bagley, I would have to look at the location and I can easily find where I am based on coordinates. That makes it easy for me to find ways to reach my destination as well as shortcuts possible. This can also transverse onto when I am taking classes and I don’t want to walk too much. By looking at the location I can see what classes are nearby me and what I should take to make it easier. The students can easily access the UW schedules as well based on location, time, professor, and much more.

If a student needed to find a specific building to go to or find, we also have a list of all the buildings and rooms, and what is available within them including how open it is. For example, if I wanted to go to AND 008, I could see that it is a classroom, what equipment they have (projector, laptop connector, speakers), the furnishing, dimensions, instructional area, how many student seating is available, as well as a picture of the area. This makes it easy for me to find what my classes will look like when I take them as well as any open classes there are.

Our data visualization type takes the student into a completely new view however. By this tab, it is easily accessible for what prerequisites I need to take based on the classes I am looking for. For example, if I plan to take AA 210, it’ll show me that I need to have already taken Math 126/136 and PHY 121. Similarly, if I plan on taking AA 260, I’d need more courses such as Chem 140/142/144/145, MATH 126/129/136, as well as PHY 121. This way looking at what I need to get accomplished would be easier and faster by simply clicking on the tab.

There is also a great amount of information based on scheduling as a whole. You can choose from courses, section, credits, days, and even teachers. I can even base on primarily on what time the class is being taught and who is teaching it. If I plan on looking at Honors 220, I can see Section A, who’s teaching it, and that the timing of the class is 3:30 to 4:30. The benefit of this is that you can pick your schedule based on class, timing, teachers, places, whether it’s open or not, or even the rating a teacher has received. Like looking up Astr 192 will let me see the section, place, time, teachers, and whether or not it’s open without going through various parts of MyPlan.

Our user can also access any fun facts that might be associated with UW Classes. By looking at the Fun Fact! tab, various and interesting fun facts can appear.

Our design overall allows the user to decide what courses they plan on taking according to the professors, location, and rating received. All of these can be easily found within the site in order to make it easier for students at UW.
