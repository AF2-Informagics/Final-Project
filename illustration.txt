Our site will allow information from rate-my-professor, the UW schedules as well as what buildings are nearby to be accessed. 
Our site would help students be able to find empty in any building they needed during a specific time of their choosing. 
By viewing our data visualization tab, it is also possible for students to explore course prerequisites they would need to fulfill. 
The user can also access the Fun Fact! tab which shows interesting facts about UW classes to pop up. 
Finally, the users can decide what courses they plan on taking according to the professors, location, and ratings received. 
All of these will be easily found and available within the site.
